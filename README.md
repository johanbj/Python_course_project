# Python_course_project
The python-script "Project_Python_Course_py" takes information about the metabolic model known as "GECKO" and plots basic available information on protein sequences in it. In addition, since there is information available on which proteins that are associated/used in different pathways, average amino acid abundancy in all proteins of each pathway is analyzed.
