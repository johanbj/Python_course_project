# Python_course_project
The python-script "Project_Python_Course_py" takes information about the metabolic model known as "GECKO" and plots basic available information on protein sequences in it. In addition, since there is information available on which proteins that are associated/used in different pathways, average amino acid abundancy in all proteins of each pathway is analyzed.

A few example files (ending with .txt), containing the data that the script will analyze, are made available in the repository.
Make sure to download and save them all in a directory on your computer that is one level above the directory in which you run the script. If you would like to go through this working example.
